A curiosity-driven Front-End Developer with design chops.
I'm passionate about bringing both the technical and visual aspects of digital products to life. User experience, beautiful pixels and writing clean accessible, human code matters to me. I sweat the details. And as a follower of John Maedaâ€™s Laws Of Simplicity, I agree that less is more.

I have a BA in Multimedia Design from Curtin University ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º, a Certificate of Web Development Immersive from Juno College (Formerly HackerYou) ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦, (and an Advanced Scuba Diving License from PADI ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­!)

I'm happiest when I'm creating, learning, exploring and thinking about how to make things better. Currently solving deceptively simple problems at UsePastel.Com. I'm not available for any freelance work, but feel free to reach out and say hello! I promise I don't bite ðŸ˜‰


Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Developer Relations Engineer at Google and I make awesome things for awesome people!

I love helping people level up with creative coding on the web platform. I'm known for whimsical creations. But also my ability to deliver innovative solutions to complex problems. I create hundreds(not exaggerated) of demos over on CodePen. I'm an author for publications such as CSS Tricks && Smashing Magazine. And as of recently, I'm now an international speaker speaking at events such as "All Day Hey!" and "Smashing Conf San Francisco".

In the past, I've worked with and for names such as Nike, Uber, Monzo, and NearForm. If you want to get in touch, come and find me on one of the many social platforms!

Stay awesome! Ê• â€¢á´¥â€¢Ê”


Since beginning my journey as a freelance designer over 11 years ago, I've done remote work for agencies, consulted for startups, and collaborated with talented people to create digital products for both business and consumer use. I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving my chops one design problem at a time.
